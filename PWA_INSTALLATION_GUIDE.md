# 📱 PWA Installation Guide - Stephly Budget Tracker

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. **Updated Manifest Configuration**

- Added proper `purpose` attributes for better compatibility
- Added language and text direction metadata

### 2. **Improved Service Worker**
- Upgraded to v3 with better caching strategy
- Added network-first, cache-fallback strategy
- Implemented `skipWaiting()` for immediate activation
- Added logging for debugging
- Improved offline support

### 3. **Enhanced PWA Installer Component**
- Created install prompt UI that appears after 5 seconds
- Added install button with beautiful gradient design
- Detects if app is already installed
- Handles dismiss functionality
- Shows only when installation is available

### 4. **Added Animations**
- Smooth slide-up animation for install prompt

5. **Click "Install Now"** button OR:
   - Look for the install icon (⊕) in the address bar
   - Click it and select "Install"

6. **App will open in standalone mode** without browser UI

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Install prompt doesn't appear**

**Causes**:
- App already installed → Check if icon is on home screen
- Browser doesn't support PWA → Use Chrome/Edge
- Need to clear browser data

**Fix**:
```powershell
# Clear all caches and restart
Remove-Item -Path .next -Recurse -Force
npm run dev
```

Then in browser:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "All time"
3. Check: Cached images and files, Cookies and site data
4. Click "Clear data"
5. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` again

### **Service Worker not registering**

**Check console** for errors:
1. Press `F12` → Console tab
2. Look for `[PWA] Service Worker registered` message
3. If you see errors, they'll appear in red

**Common fixes**:
- Make sure `/sw.js` file exists in `public` folder
- Restart dev server
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

### **App installed but doesn't work offline**

**Check**:
1. DevTools → Application → Service Workers
2. Make sure service worker is "activated and running"
3. Click "Update" to force service worker update
4. Try "Unregister" then refresh to re-register

### **Icons not showing**

**Verify icon exists**:
- File should be at: `public/logo/stephly.png`
- Must be at least 512x512 pixels
- PNG format recommended

- **Purple/pink gradient** matching your app theme

To change timing, edit `PWAInstaller.tsx`:
```tsx
// Line 61 - Change 5000 to desired milliseconds
setTimeout(() => {
  setShowInstallPrompt(true);
}, 5000); // 5 seconds
```

## 🔄 Deployment Notes

3. **Test on real devices** after deployment

4. **Update service worker cache version** when making changes:
   ```js
   const CACHE_NAME = 'stephly-v4'; // Increment version
   ```

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Start dev server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Test installation** on your device
